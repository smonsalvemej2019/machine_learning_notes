# What is machine learning?

Machine learning is about learning patterns not rules. For example we have a machine that can do typed arithmetic and we feed it "two plu two". The machine might give us the right answer, but it does not know the rules of arithmetic, it knows a common pattern.

When dealing with machine learning, do not reinvent the wheel. Use the pre-existing tools, examples, and libraries.

## Strategies

1. Just Watch
2. Tinker
3. Build something from the ground up



## The two different angles

- A subset of Artificial Intelligence.
- An extension of data science

# Data Science Ecosystem

1. Start with an interesting question.
2. import the data
3. clean it up
4. understand the data 
5. transform it
6. model it 
7. deploy and maintain the model.

## Takeaways

Data prep is time consuming.

Spending time getting familiar with the data is beneficial. 

Do not lose sight of the original question through development.

Keep your stakeholders in mind.

Deployment and maintenance is a challenge.

## Key questions 
- What are your goals?
    - To understand and trust the data.

- What techniques should you use?
    - Summary of statistics and visualization.

- Which tools should you use.
    -The python data science stack (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

## Exploratory data analysis

We usually sample the data, then we use probability models to make inferences.

When running into problems, it might be either a problem with the data or with the model itself.

### Summary statistics and vis tools

Summary statistics can only go so far as providing a general feel of the data.

visualization can help a lot!

sometimes statistics is not enough information.


### Techniques and recommendations.

1. Single Var Exploration: Start with a single variables. look at the distribution and chose appropriate summary statistics.
2. Pair-Wise Exploration: Identify a correlation, look at tables and scatter plots. compute linear fits.
3. Multivariate Analysis: If there is more relationships with the data then add variables and make a more complex model
4. Estimation and Hypothesis testing:
    - How big is the effect?
    - How much will it change when measured again?
    - Is it possible that the effect is due to change?
5. Visualization: Good tool to show relationships.
